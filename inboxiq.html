								This chrome extension was built with security in mind. You
								provide your own API key and the extension will never store your

					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<p>
						Two things are required from you; First it only works for Gmail
						(Sorry outlook people, its a Google Chrome extension), Second you
						will provide your own API key. This is easy to obtain and we have a
						guide for you. Once you have the extension installed and the API key
						in place, you can start summarizing emails.

							<h3>OpenAi API</h3>
							<p>
								You need an api key from OpenAi to use the extension. This is
								for your own security! We dont want to store, process or even
								look at your emails. OpenAi the creators of Chat GPT offer a
								robust security policy and are an industry leader in privacy
								with Ai. Once you obtain an api key from them, you can start
								using the extension.

					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						Welcome to InboxIQ. This privacy policy outlines how we collect,
						use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.
					</p>

					<h3>Information We Process</h3>
					<p>InboxIQ accesses and processes the following information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Email content from your Gmail account</li>
						<li>Email thread IDs</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This information is processed within your browser and is also sent
						to third-party AI services for generating summaries and responses.
						It is never sent anywhere else to be viewed, processed, or stored by
						us. This is extremely important to us and why we require users to
						provide the API key, so the data processed is linked to your own LLM
						account.
					</p>

					<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
					<p>
						The information accessed by InboxIQ is used solely for the purpose
						of providing you with email summaries and facilitating conversations
						about your emails. While initial processing occurs in your browser,
						the data is sent to third-party AI services for generating
						responses.
					</p>

					<h3>Data Transmission to Third Parties</h3>
					<p>
						InboxIQ sends email data to third-party AI services, such as OpenAI,
						to generate summaries and responses. We require users to provide
						their own API keys for these services. This practice ensures that:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You have control over which AI service processes your data</li>
						<li>
							The processing adheres to the privacy policies of the chosen AI
							service
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						For instance, OpenAI's privacy policy states that when you provide
						your own API key, they do not store or use your data for training
						purposes. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any AI
						service you choose to use with InboxIQ.
					</p>

					<h3>Data Storage</h3>
					<p>
						InboxIQ uses Chrome's local storage to save conversation history and
						settings. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to
						or stored on our servers.
					</p>

					<h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
					<p>InboxIQ uses the following third-party services:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication</li>
						<li>
							AI services (such as OpenAI) for generating email summaries and
							responses
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						While using these services, please be aware of their respective
						privacy policies.
					</p>

					<h3>Data Security</h3>
					<p>
						We take the security of your data seriously. All communication with
						third-party APIs is done using secure HTTPS connections. Your API
						keys for AI services are stored securely in Chrome's local storage
						and are only used to make requests to the respective AI services.
					</p>

					<h3>User Control</h3>
					<p>
						You have full control over the data stored by InboxIQ. You can
						delete all stored conversations at any time using the 'Delete All'
						function in the extension. You also control which AI service
						processes your data by providing your own API key.
					</p>

					<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
					<p>
						We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify
						users of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page
						and updating the extension.
					</p>

					<h3>Contact Us</h3>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact
						us at rjbulcher@gmail.com.
					</p>

					<p>Last updated: July 22, 2024</p>
