                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to InboxIQ. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>

                <h3>Information We Process</h3>
                <p>InboxIQ accesses and processes the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email content from your Gmail account</li>
                    <li>Email thread IDs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This information is processed within your browser and is also sent to third-party AI services for generating summaries and responses. It is never sent anywhere else to be viewed, processed, or stored by us. This is extremely important to us and why we require users to provide the API key, so the data processed is linked to your own LLM account.</p>

                <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
                <p>The information accessed by InboxIQ is used solely for the purpose of providing you with email summaries and facilitating conversations about your emails. While initial processing occurs in your browser, the data is sent to third-party AI services for generating responses.</p>

                <h3>Data Transmission to Third Parties</h3>
                <p>InboxIQ sends email data to third-party AI services, such as OpenAI, to generate summaries and responses. We require users to provide their own API keys for these services. This practice ensures that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have control over which AI service processes your data</li>
                    <li>The processing adheres to the privacy policies of the chosen AI service</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For instance, OpenAI's privacy policy states that when you provide your own API key, they do not store or use your data for training purposes. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any AI service you choose to use with InboxIQ.</p>

                <h3>Data Storage</h3>
                <p>InboxIQ uses Chrome's local storage to save conversation history and settings. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>InboxIQ uses the following third-party services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication</li>
                    <li>OpenAI for generating email summaries and responses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While using these services, please be aware of their respective privacy policies.</p>

                <h3>Data Security</h3>
                <p>We take the security of your data seriously. All communication with third-party APIs is done using secure HTTPS connections. Your API keys for AI services are stored securely in Chrome's local storage and are only used to make requests to the respective AI services.</p>

                <h3>User Control</h3>
                <p>You have full control over the data stored by InboxIQ. You can delete all stored conversations at any time using the 'Delete All' function in the extension. You also control which AI service processes your data by providing your own API key.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the extension.</p>

                <h3>Contact Us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at rjbulcher@gmail.com.</p>
